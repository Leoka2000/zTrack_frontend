    "description": "The core of the ZTrack system is a smart activity sensor designed to bring harmony to modern grazing. It continuously monitors the location and behavior of your livestock, sending immediate alerts if it detects theft, straying, or abnormal inactivity. Using ultra-low power NB-IoT technology and integrated solar charging, the sensor operates for months without maintenance. Every data point is saved to the cloud, allowing you to review herd movements and pasture pressure through our dedicated map application. Housed in a robust IP6X casing, it withstands the harshest field conditions while keeping you connected to the rhythm of your land.",

      {
        "question": "How does the ZTrack G-100 maintain power in remote areas?",
        "answer": "The G-100 features high-efficiency solar harvesting. With just 3 hours of direct daily sunlight, the device stays fully charged, ensuring continuous monitoring without manual intervention."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if an animal moves out of cellular range?",
        "answer": "Our devices utilize NB-IoT and LTE-M for deep rural penetration. If cellular signals fail, the G-100 can store location data internally and sync once a connection is re-established."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the GPS tracking for individual animals?",
        "answer": "The ZTrack G-100 uses a multi-constellation GNSS receiver (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo) providing pinpoint accuracy within 2.5 meters under clear sky conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I set up virtual boundaries for my herd?",
        "answer": "Yes! Through our mobile app, you can create custom Geofences. If any animal crosses these boundaries, you will receive an instant push notification or SMS alert."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the hardware durable enough for harsh weather?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. The G-100 is IP67-rated, making it fully waterproof and dustproof. It is tested to operate in extreme temperatures ranging from -20°C to +60°C."

    "title": "Our Mission at ZTrack",
    "description": "We started with a simple belief that technology should serve the earth and those who tend to it. Agriculture is the backbone of our existence, yet it remains one of the most demanding professions on the planet. Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional wisdom and modern efficiency. By providing real time insights and intelligent tracking, we allow farmers to step away from constant manual oversight and focus on the bigger picture. We are not just building software, we are creating a more sustainable and predictable future for global food production. Every sensor we deploy and every map we generate is designed with the user in mind. We prioritize simplicity because we know that out in the field, tools need to work without complications. We are committed to honesty, innovation, and the long term success of every farm that joins our network. Thank you for being part of this journey toward a smarter and more harmonious farming experience."
